## What is Hamiltonian simulation?

Hamiltonian simulation methods are a widely studied area and have been used to efficiently simulate physical quantum systems 
and to construct quantum algorithms that rely on Hamiltonian dynamics. A Hamiltonian H(t) of a system is an operator that represents the total energy of a given quantum system.
The eigenvalue for a specific eigenstate of H(t) represent the energy of the state represented by the eigenstate.
We also require that H(t) is Hermitian to ensure the energies are real valued.
<!-- The ground state of a 
Hamiltonian corresponds to the eigenstate with the smallest eigenvalue. This represents the state with the lowest energy level. Finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian is a particularly useful problem 
used in many quantum applications (i.e. quantum verification, quantum algorithms, etc.) and is generally difficult for even quantum computer. "Simulating" a Hamiltonian can refer to finding the ground state
of a Hamiltonian, but can also refer to describing a quantum system at a given time t. -->

While the term *Hamiltonian simulation* can refer to different tasks,
in this project we are mainly interested in describing the time-evolution of a given physical system,
which also is determined by its Hamiltonian through Schrödinger's equation.
Namely, for a quantum state
![phi-t](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl={\quad}|\phi(t)\rangle{\quad}),
we have
![schrodinger-eq](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl={\quad}i\hbar|\phi'(t)\rangle=H(t)|\phi(t)\rangle{\quad}), 
where ![hbar](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=\hbar) is Planck's constant. Given the initial condition at time
![teq0](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl={\quad}t=0{\quad}),
we can solve this differential equation to find the quantum state at any later time t. 

Hamiltonians can be time independent, or time dependent. In this work, we will only consider time-independent Hamiltonians. For time independent hamiltonians, the solution of the Schrodinger equation is
![sol-ti](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl={\quad}|\phi(t)\rangle=e^{-iHt/\hbar}|\phi(0)\rangle{\quad}). 
A Hamiltonian H is efficiently simulatable if for any t > 0, &epsilon; > 0, there exists a polynomial-sized quantum circuit C such that
![sol-circuit](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl={\quad}\mid|C-H(t)\mid|<\varepsilon{\quad}). In our work, we will formally prove 
properites of Hamiltonians and their efficient simulations. 

## Relevant works

Notable work on formally verified quantum computing using Coq has been done before, notably in [this library](https://rand.cs.uchicago.edu/vqc/) by Robert Rand, [SQIR/VOQC](https://github.com/inQWIRE/SQIR), and [QWIRE](https://github.com/inQWIRE/QWIRE). The first library implements the basics of quantum computation including qubits, measurements, and small quantum circuits and the latter three libraries implement many more advanced features. We expect `matrix.v` in QWIRE to be especially helpful as it proves many linear algebra fundamentals.

To the best of our knowledge, formal verification of Hamiltonian simulation semantics is new. Our main contribution will be to prove theorems on the semantics of both commuting and non-commuting Hamiltonians, which will involve formulating a Coq representaion of the exponentiation of a matrix.

## Syntax

Hamiltonian evolutions can be specified using a simple domain-specific language.
We first describe its syntax through an example, then we present its formal grammar.

### Example

The following is a valid Hamiltonian simulation program:

```
Site
    fock "F1"
    qubit "Q1"
    qubit "Q2"
    qubit "Q3" ;
Hamiltonian
    ( "H1" : R1 , "Q1" > X * "Q2" > Z + "Q3" > Y )
    ( "H2" : R1 , "Q2" > Y )
    ( "H3" : R1 , "F1" > c )
```

A program contains two sections: *Site* and *Hamiltonian*.
In our *Site* section, variables are declared. In this example, we have `F1` of type fock, as well as `Q1`, `Q2`, and `Q3` of type qubit.
In the *Hamiltonian* section, the desired physical evolution is specified.
In our example, we have three Hamiltonians, <!-- google charts LaTeX workaround; you hate to see it -->
* ![H1](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl={\quad}H_1=\mathsf{I}{\otimes}\mathsf{X}{\otimes}\mathsf{Z}{\otimes}\mathsf{I}%2B\mathsf{I}{\otimes}\mathsf{I}{\otimes}\mathsf{I}{\otimes}\mathsf{Y}{\quad})
* ![H2](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl={\quad}H_2=\mathsf{I}{\otimes}\mathsf{I}{\otimes}\mathsf{Y}{\otimes}\mathsf{I}{\quad})
* ![H3](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl={\quad}H_3=c{\otimes}\mathsf{I}{\otimes}\mathsf{I}{\otimes}\mathsf{I}{\quad})

which are applied for one unit of time each.

### Formal grammar

* `A`: identifier
* `z`: complex number
* `r`: real number
* `t`: positive real number.

```
Type := "qubit" | "fock"
Operator := Id | X | Y | Z | a | c
Declaration := (T A)*
Scalar := S_1 + S_2 | S_1 * S_2 | S_1 - S_2 | S_1 / S_2 | exp(S) | cos(S) | sin(S) | z | r
TIH := M_1 + M_2 | M_1 * M_2 | S * M | A.O
TIH_Sequence := (A : t, M)*
Program := "Site" Declaration; "Hamiltonian" TIH_Sequence
```

TIH stands for time-independent Hamiltonian.

## Project Goals

First, we will implement the formal syntax, following how `Imp` is parsed in the [Software Foundations textbook](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html).
We then either prove some facts on Hamiltonian evolution semantics, or implement compilation to quantum circuits. Both if time permits.

### Semantics

We aim to prove when different Hamiltonians have the same semantics, that is, when they have the same effect on any given state.
In particular, if `H_1` and `H_2` commute, then `(H_1: t_1) (H_2: t_2)` and `(H_2: t_2) (H_1: t_1)` have the same semantics. 

One challenge will be representing matrix exponentials. We plan to define this symbolically (since the formal definition requires an infinite sum) and state valid rewrite rules that respect Schrödinger's equation.

### Compilation

Another goal of this project is to implement and prove facts about Hamiltonian compilation. Given some universal gate set `G` and a Hamiltonian `H`, this involves constructing a program `P : list G` such that `P` and `H` have the same effect on a quantum state.
If time permits, we may attempt to compile the Hamiltonian into a popular quantum programming language such as [OpenQASM](https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm),
so that it can be run on a simulator or a real quantum computer.
This involves printing out the list of gates in the right syntax and [has been done](https://github.com/inQWIRE/SQIR/tree/main/examples/shor) for Shor's algorithm for integer factorization.
<!-- Ethan: How about the correctness of compilation? Has the formal semantics of qasm been defined anywhere? -->

The method of compilation will be via *trotterization*. Trotterization decomposes the unitary induced by a Hamiltonian into a product of local terms. 
We can then analyze its properties by, for example, proving the error bound on trotterization for non-commuting Hamiltonians.

## Project Timeline

### Week 1

Survey available libraries to see exactly which auxillary lemmas we have, especially matrix.v from QWIRE. Write defninitions and theorem statements (which we will admit for now) for the following:

* Define Hermitian property of a matrix (i.e. matrix is self-adjoint)
* Define matrix diagonalization
* Prove that Hermitian matrices are diagonalizable
* Prove that Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues
* Define Tensor products and Kronecker products.
* Prove that Hermitian matrices are closed under additions and Kronecker products
* Define matrix exponentials
* Non-Hermitian "Hamiltonians" should probably be rejected?
* Define when two Hamiltonians have the same semantics
* Prove Hamiltonian associativity
* Prove that if Hamiltonians commute, swapping their order results in the same program
* Define the compiler, which turns a Hamiltonian into a list of gates
* Formulate the statement of the compiler error bound (i.e., O(m^2 T^2 ||Hi||^2 / N) ) in terms of the relevant quantities

Some other work will be:
* Fix a few bugs in the syntax parser (currently syntax.v)
* Understand the proof of error bound for trotterization
* Learn QASM and how to compile programs.

### Week 2

Once we have defined our problems, we will split up the work among the group. Then we will prove some of the theorems we stated in week 1. These will include all the basic theorems listed above, i.e., those about linear algebra operations. We will also begin the work on the main theorems.

### Week 3

In week 3, we will continue our work on the main theorems. The goal will be to prove most of our main results, or at least be close, by the end of the week. We will evaluate our progress heading into the final week and begin one or more additional problems if we have time.

### Week 4

The final week will be for finishing the work we have started in the previous weeks. We will finalize our work into a complete project and write the final report.
